OVERVIEW
This website consists of three pages: "index.html", "bio.hml", and "resume.html", each correctly implemented with valid HTML5 and CSS3. Its purpose is to serve as an online resume for myself (but I've gone ahead and disabled search crawling because I'm not yet prepared to put all of this information out there for people to find.)

DESIGNER'S NOTES
I was disappointed to find that I couldn't change the text-selection color (thanks to W3C CSS validation requirements), but otherwise, things went smoothly. This was my first time using Google's webfonts, and that worked beautifully.

CREDITS
This project was completed by Brian Pilchik, working alone, in approximately 6 hours (January/February 2014).
